## [Home](./index.html)/photography.html

Back in the old, wayback days of 2008, I held all my photos on **Fotki** which promised unlimited free storage of original-sized photos
on their servers. As a naive 16-year-old, I believed them and kept everything on there. At some point they got into financial trouble, 
and started charging for storage - going so far as ransoming my originals, not allowing me to download a backup until I had paid a 
subscription. 

Thinking I'd learned, I started keeping my own backups, but curated nicer shots onto Flickr. That seemed pretty smart. Over the years though,
Flickr has messed with their login systems - use a Yahoo account, use a Flickr account, use a Yahoo email, use your real email - blah! The end 
result of all of these migrations is my account is no longer accessible to me. The plan now is to curate my own collection, keeping them 
on Google Drive and Github - there's no way that can go wrong, right? 

Once I find a satisfactory gallery implementation, this page will be updated. 
In the meantime, you can see my old photos on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/slootus).

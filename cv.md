*I'm a software enthusiast with a history of Physics and teaching. I've worked on some large enterprise projects
 in telecommunications requiring rigorous documentation, and written physics simulation 
 software for academic purposes(read: un-maintainable messes that do the job). My side-projects tend to sit somewhere 
 in-between these two.*

**Good knowledge of:** Python, Linux, HTML, jinja2, XML, VMWare, Jenkins, testing

**Experience with:** C, Django, virtual machines, Javascript, apache, DigitalOcean, Selenium, CSS, PicoC, Git

Work Experience
---------------
**2018 - 2019 Science Teacher**
*Teaching between 10 - 16 hours of Biology/Physics/Chemistry at GCSE and A-level. While a departure from
coding, the experience taught me:*

- Effective organization and note-keeping. I ended the year with robust Trello boards seamlessly integrated to 
my Calendar and to-do list apps. This has made my life orders of magnitudes less stressful since. 

- Modern educational theories and techniques. This has given me insight into my own learning, changing the way 
I tackle new projects and programming languages.

- The value of automation and templating. The profession is rife with systems that require you to enter the same
data into several different programs with different layouts. This tendency drove me to automate my lesson plan creation. 

- So many PowerPoint tricks I never wanted to know. 


**2015 - 2018 Eurofins Digital Testing, Software Engineer**

*The company sells a product called Ligada, which is an automated testing harness and test suite for TV and set-top box manufacturers. I worked on various projects in the company, with teams sized between three 
and 20. The nature of conformance testing placed high importance on maintaining legacy functionality, and each feature was thoroughly unit and integration tested. My specific responsibilities were:*

- Adding new features to the automated test tool, mainly in **Python** and **Django**. 

- Ownership of the release process. Several concurrent projects with separate release dates meant merges had to be clean without unfinished work ending up with clients. I updated documentation practices, overhauled our media folder tree, 
and added features to the build system to save several hours from each release, and reduced human errors

- Interpreting technical specifications written by the client and designing automated tests for TVs while considering the limitations of the test harness design, limitations of third party embedded systems, and coming up with new requirements for both as necessary. Test case automation code mainly written in **Javascript** and **XML**, with some **PicoC** scripts to run on the embedded systems. 

- Onboarding of new team members of varying skill to projects, including mentoring new graduate hires around company standards and procedures.

- Generating and modifying video and audio files with **ffmpeg** to generate media with specific parameters to test broadcast/IPTV performance of TVs.

- Cooperating with several international third party partners to provide support with our software, and diagnosing bugs from mutual early access programs to speed up development for both parties. 

- Social sec - control of the yearâ€™s social budget for an office of 35 people, budgeting and organization of casual social events, team building exercises and improving office culture e.g. setting up a communal chess game and various tournaments.


Education
---------------

2018 - 2019 Bath Spa University, Secondary Science with Physics (degree not completed)

2011 - 2015 University of Southampton, MPhys Physics, 2:1 honours

Relevant modules: 

- Simulated annealing and Monte Carlo simulations to study various physical processes, such as the growing of crystals and fractals. Written in **C** and **Python**. 

- For my Master's project I wrote two particle simulators in Python, validated them against experimental results, and studied the trade-offs between various computational power optimizations and physical accuracy.

Recent Projects
---------------

- [**rightcommute.co.uk**](https://www.rightcommute.app) - A small web-app to help with house hunting. Uses Google Maps APIs to get directions to several addresses at once. Written in Python with Flask, jinja2 templating, MySQL, hosted on DigitalOcean. 

- **TULIP** - A simple commandline program to convert PowerPoints used in lessons into word doc lesson plans in the layouts required by the school. Saves about 10 minutes of copy-pasting and formatting per lesson, ~3 hours/week.

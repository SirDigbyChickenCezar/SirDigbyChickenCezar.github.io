  I'm a software enthusiast with a history of Physics and teaching. I've worked on some large enterprise projects
  in telecommunications, written simulation software for science papers and made a few apps 
  in my spare time. 
  
  My current goal is to become an expert in web-app development, and improve my front-end design skills.

## Skills

Good knowledge of: Python, Linux, unit testing, Jenkins, Photoshop, HTML

Some experience with: C, Django, virtual machines, Javascript, DigitalOcean, Selenium, CSS

## Work Experience 

#### 2018 - 2019 Science Teacher

> Teaching between 10 - 16 hours of Biology/Physics/Chemistry at GCSE and A-level. While not strictly related to
coding, the experience taught me: 

*   Effective organization and note-keeping. I ended the year with robust Trello boards seamlessly integrated to 
my Calendar and to-do list apps. This has made my life orders of magnitudes less stressful since. 

*   Modern educational theories and techniques. This has given me insight into my own learning, changing the way 
I tackle new projects and programming languages.

*   The value of automation and templating. The profession is rife with systems that require you to enter the same
data into several different programs with different layouts. This tendency drove me to automate my lesson plan creation. 

*   So many PowerPoint tricks I never wanted to know. 


### 2015 - 2018 Eurofins Digital Testing (formerly Digital TV Labs)

#### Software Engineer

> My main responsibilities were coding a testing automation tool, and tests for conformance testing of CI Plus,  which is a DRM standard for TV manufacturers. I was also the social sec from soon after joining.  Specific responsibilities included:  

*   Coding the automated test tool, mainly in **Python** and **Django**. High importance on maintaining the legacy code functionality and large emphasis on unit & integration testing.

*   Ownership of the release process. The work was done on a singular repository with several concurrent projects, so effective communication between teams and clear documentation was essential.

*   Interpreting technical specifications written by the client and designing automated conformance tests for TVs while considering the limitations of the test harness design, limitations of third party embedded systems, and coming  up  with  new  requirements  for  both  as  necessary. Test  case  automation  code  mainly  written  in **Javascript**, with some **PicoC** scripts to run on the embedded systems. 

*   Onboarding of new members to the team in the later parts of projects, including mentoring new graduate hires around company standards and procedures.

*   Cooperating with several international third party partners to provide support with our software, and diagnosing bugs from mutual early access programs to speed up development for both parties. 

*    Social sec - control of the year’s social budget for an office of 35 people, and responsible for budgeting and overall organization of casual social events, team building exercises and improving office culture e.g. setting up a communal chess game and various tournaments.


## Education 

### 2018 - 2019 Bath Spa University 

#### PGCE - Secondary Science with Physics, degree not completed 

> I was interested in a teaching career, so I decided to do a Postgraduate course in Secondary Science teaching. My degree was cut 7 weeks short due to circumstances out of my control. 

### 2011 - 2015 University of Southampton 

#### MPhys Physics, 2:1 honours 

Relevant modules: 

*   Numerical Methods (Python) 

*   My  3rd  year  programming  projects  involved  simulated  annealing  and  Monte  Carlo  simulations  to  study various physical processes, such as the growing of crystals and fractals. Written in C. 

*   My Master’s project consisted of writing two particle simulators in Python, validating them against experimental results, and studying their accuracy versus 

### Recent Projects

*    [rightcommute.co.uk](https://www.rightcommute.app) - A small web-app to help with house hunting. Uses Google Maps APIs to get directions to several addresses at once. Written in Python with Flask, jinja2 templating, MySQL, hosted on DigitalOcean. 

*   TULIP - A simple commandline program to convert PowerPoints used in lessons into word doc lesson plans in the layouts required by the school. Saves about 10 minutes of copy-pasting and formatting per lesson.

title: "Choosing an appropriate image for sandroid.dev"
---

This is a problem that actually took me a whole day - what kind of a photo should be on the top left of sandroid.dev? 
I toyed around with the idea of having nothing at all there, and that looks actually looks alright. Plus,
it's frowned upon to have a photo of yourself on a CV anyway, and this site is essentially an extended resume. 

But I still wanted *something* there, to give the site a bit of personality. Maybe it could be just a pretty image 
I'd generated to give the place a bit of personality? For the better part of the day, this Blender generated 3D image of 
some glitchy bananas was the number one contender:

Damn, those bananas look sweet. I still really like this shot, and will definitely use it somewhere. Unfortunately it just
felt a bit out of place next to the CV. I also considered a few other similarly generic photos, 
like a neural-netted photo of the Suspension Bridge, or a photo of a wintery beach on my hometown.

These both look nice and quite calm. I could see myself being happy to hang out on a website with just a lovely view. However, 
after looking at other developers' sites for inspiration, I found myself liking the sites that had a profile photo of the 
owner in them - the sites felt out of place without one. So I decided on a more traditional, Linked-In compatible photo. 

So I asked Google Photos to show me photos with my face in them (which it is scarily good at sometimes), and I got a collection of mostly 
selfies and some nice looking holiday snaps. Here's the one I liked best:

That looks alright I think. But when I look at it, it just screams holiday photo to me. And it looks a bit too ordinary - it's  **my website**, so I 
figure I could afford to add a bit of personality to it. So I opened up Topaz Labs and messed with a bunch of sliders until I found something I liked, and 
came up with this:

![Full On](/images/full_molt.jpg)

I think that looks pretty cool. The reduced colour range goes well with the otherwise minimalistic site, and the sky in the background looks great. Unfortunately,
the filter also smudged my face into oblivion. So, to resurrect it, I masked out the face in Lightroom and played with the structure and contrast. The finished 
result is what you see on in the profile: 

![Edited](/profile_photo.jpg)

I think that looks grand. Or at least, good enough. 





### Bonus: 

This is an old edit I did when messing about with neural nets, and was tempted to use. 

I decided it had a bit **too much** personality and looks a bit extreme. But I still really like this image.

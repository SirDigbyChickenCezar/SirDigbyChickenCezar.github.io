# Profile Photos 

This took me a while - what kind of a photo should be on sandroid.dev? It's frowned upon to have a photo of yourself
on a CV, but it would be a bit weird to have a general, internetty "avatar" as well. For a whole day the number one 
contender was a glitchy, Blender-generated still of some 3D bananas.

Damn, those bananas look sweet. I also considered a few similar bits, like a neural-netted photo of the Suspension Bridge,
or a photo of a wintery beach on my hometown.

In the end though, I decided on a more traditional, Linked-In compatible photo. But since it's **my website**, I could afford to add a *little* bit of personality to it. So I took a fairly neutral photo, and messed with the colours on it to make it slightly artsy. I think the reduced colour pallette works well with the overall minimalistic feel of the site.

And, after editing:

I think that looks grand. Or at least, good enough. 




### Bonus: 
This one, I decided, had a bit **too much** personality. But I still really like this image.
